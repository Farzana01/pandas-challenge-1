# pandas-challenge-1
This challenge is to dive into a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, exploring and analyzing data to address real-world business questions which involves identifying top customers, popular product categories, calculating profits, etc. 

I have used github co-pilot to understand code and also met with my peers very briefly. We did not discuss code, but we agreed that we need to practice from the activities and then we will be able to understand the code.
